description: "The coffin being lowered into the ground contains a friend of mine"

	The warm summer sun gently toasts the back of my neck and, as I look around, I can see the trees and flowers in full bloom.  I gently close my eyes.  The blackness slowly surrounds me and I can almost feel myself floating away.  A firm hand clasps my shoulder and I start back.
I’m standing at the back, behind a wall of suits, so I can’t see the priest as he’s reading some long, pointless script about resurrection and life.  I don’t really need to see or hear though – I know more about resurrection, life and death than he does.  He’ll find out soon enough though – they all will.
	The coffin being lowered into the ground contains a friend of mine; his name was Steven Ashworth, and it’s my fault that he’s dead.
	It started around 3 months ago, at the start of March.  
My family had just moved from a rough, but familiar area in North London where I grew-up.  We had come here, to Buxton, because my father had decided that that was what we should do.  He’d left his job, up sticks and moved.  I was in the last year at school, so when I got here, I didn’t really see the point of going back to school – it’s not like I was destined for greatness or anything.
	We moved to a street on a hill, which is a pretty unremarkable thing here.  Since I didn’t have school to go to, I spent most of my days wondering around the park at the bottom of the hill.  The sign outside claimed it was “The Pavilion Gardens” – but it looked like a park to me.  That’s where I met Ste.
	Like me, Ste didn’t really see the long term advantages of learning the state sponsored curriculum.  He was a year younger than me but he’d reached the zenith of knowledge at this early age: that once you can read – you don’t need the government to tell you what to read, and when.
	It was after about two or three weeks of wondering around the park, chasing pigeons and pilfering from the surrounding shops and market that we started to go into the theatre next to the gardens.  The Buxton Opera House it was called – but they never seemed to show any Opera there!
	We found a way to sneak into some of the shows – you’d be surprised how people will assume that you’re supposed to be where you are, as long as you tell them that’s so.  We’d go in about ten minutes after the start of the performance and usually, they just let us in.  It depended on the show, but we managed to get in about three or four a week without paying.  Of course, you couldn’t do this every day, and never at weekends.  This whole process was greatly eased when we met Bert.
	Bert was an ex-actor.  He told us he used to be in Hollywood back in the 60s.  He said that they’d asked him to direct a few films, but he’d turned them down to come back to Buxton.  Alright, so he was full of crap – who isn’t?  He was working at the Opera House as a kind of odd-job man – but his specialty seemed to be electrics: “I can make anything go with enough power” he’d say, in that strange, high pitched, croaky voice of his.
	
This one time, Bert came looking for us in the gardens.
“Dears!  Won’t you come to my Birthday bash!” he screeched.
“Your birthday? Yeah,” Ste answered, looking confused.
“Excellent, I’m writing a new play and would simply love you hear your praise!  Eleven Sharp!”  he cooed, wondering off, walking away from the opera house.
“Bert,” shouted Ste, “Aren’t you supposed to be working?”
“Yes, Dear!” he called back without pausing.
We turned up at the Opera house at 11pm and he let us in.  It was eerie in there at that time – like being in a crypt or something.  He ushered us into the theatre and told us to sit down, then he disappeared.  A few minute later the curtain came up and a load of cardboard characters stood on the stage.  He hadn’t made them – it looked like he’d just taken them from video shops or cinemas – they appeared to be of various movie characters that you might see on a poster.
Bert ran onto stage, and began to shake the characters slightly as he spoke for each, to give an indication of who was speaking.
Shrek: “Shaun, you will never make a career from acting!”
Rambo: “I beg to differ, Gregory.  I am a great actor and shall have a long and glamorous career as a Hollywood superstar!”
Shrek: “You’re a fool, man – you’re a bartender – how can a bartender make it to Hollywood?”
Sandra Bullock: “Let Shaun have his dreams, Greg,”
Obi-Wan Kenobi: “I don’t pay you three to stand around here talking – people are waiting to be served!”
This went on, telling the story of Shaun, a bartender trying to get to America to kick-start his part-time, faltering acting career.  When it was finished, Bert ran to the front of the stage and sat down, his legs dangling over the front.
“What did you think?”
“It was a bit difficult to tell who was saying what with those figures, but it seemed okay,” said Ste, turning to me and daring me to contradict.
I smiled at Bert, “I was great, Bert!”
I mean – he puts on a play in front of the two of us for an hour and then asks us if it was any good!  I’d never heard such a croc of shite in my life – but I wasn’t going to tell him, was I?
Bert looked a little crestfallen.
“It doesn’t work with the cardboard cut-outs?” he asked, looking at Ste.
“Not really.  Maybe you could get some of the actors that do the plays in the daytime to give it a run?”
“I suggested it to them!  Can you believe that they said no – they hardly even looked at the script!  Bastards!”
He sat for a while with his head down, thinking.  We looked at each other uncomfortably, and finally Ste stood up.
“Look, Bert – we’ve got to go,”
“Yes, of course,”
“Let us know if you manage to get some bodies for the play,” he said as we wondered towards the exit.
Suddenly Bert jumped off the stage.
“That’s it!” he shouted, “What a superb idea!”
He was stalking about the theatre now, looking wildly around and muttering something.
“Okay, well.. err… see you around, Bert!”
“Oh, but Steven, you must come back the day after tomorrow!”  he looked at me, “And you, Daniel!  I think I know who I can get to act my play!”
“Great,” we both mumbled as we fell over ourselves to get out.

We avoided the opera house for a few days after that.  Bert had looked a bit mad and we didn’t really want him getting us arrested for breaking and entering or anything.  The following week, though, it started raining, and we needed somewhere to keep dry, so we headed back.
“I’ve looked everywhere for you two!” he screeched as we walked into the end of the afternoon play.
“Good to see you again, Bert,” I offered.
“Tonight, Eleven O’clock,” he whispered as we sat down.

We arrived about half past, because we’d been arguing whether to go at all.  We knocked twice, as per the arranged signal, and he came through to answer.  As he let us in, he looked happier than we’d ever seen him.  His eyes glittered like a child with a new toy.
“How the hell do you reckon he managed to get actors to star in this?” Ste whispered to me as we followed him through.
As we opened the door to the stage area, the curtain was down and the stage in darkness.  Bert ran off and there was silence for two or three minutes
“Take a seat, boys!” came high pitched, exited squeal from somewhere.
We sat down about three rows back and waited.
The curtain began to move about five minutes later, although the stage was still dark.
Suddenly, the stage lit up and a line of people stood on the stage, they all wore slightly tattered suites, and hats that obscured their faces.  A man to the right of the stage began to gesture.  The voice was still Bert’s, but the lips seemed to be moving.
“Shaun, you will never make a career from acting!”
A man standing just to the left of him turned in a very mechanical fashion, and began gesturing back, “I beg to differ, Gregory.  I am a great actor and shall have a long and glamorous career as a Hollywood superstar!”
Again the voice was Bert’s.
“Do you reckon these are robots or something?” Ste asked.
“You’re a fool, man – you’re a bartender – how can a bartender make it to Hollywood?” answered Bert, while the first actor gestured.
“Let Shaun have his dreams, Greg,” replied Bert, as a woman to the left of the stage began to walk forward.  
Suddenly, she collapsed to the floor.  Her hat rolled away, and Ste began to retch.
The woman’s eyes were just empty sockets.  One or two insects seemed to be crawling in and out of them.  The rest of the flesh seemed to be hanging off, mostly rotten and in places bone was shining through.
I felt pretty ill myself.  I wondered to the stage in a kind of daze, trying to see what had happened.  I still thought that these were some kind of robots, and we were just the victims of some kind of macabre optical illusion.
It was no illusion, as I approached the stage, I could smell how real it was.  The actors that Bert had found were dead, and had been for some considerable time.
Bert realised what had happened and had come running to the stage.  Once he’d left whatever controls he was using, the other corpses returned to their decaying state.  Now that I had a closer look, I could see that each actor had a small electrode on their feet, arms, hands, legs and head.  Tiny rivulets of smoke swirled from each.
“You’re one sick twat!” coughed Ste as he retched again.


I hadn’t seen Ste for a few weeks, when he found me wondering around the park.
“We’ve got to stop him, you know!” he said.
I’d been thinking the same myself, but was too chicken to actually do anything.
“What can we do?  Has he even done anything wrong?” I asked.
“Are you taking the piss?” he answered, irritated.
“Look, he hasn’t hurt anyone has he?”
“Pretty soon he’ll start an epidemic or something!  There is a reason that we bury our dead, you know!” he answered.
A little girl rode past on her scooter and I looked after her, realising he was right.  I liked Bert, but this was getting out of hand.
“What do you want to do, shop him?” I asked, finally.
“Maybe,” he looked unsure now, “I don’t know!”
There was an idea lurking at the outside of my consciousness.
“What if we scared him off?”
“How would we manage that?” retorted Ste, “He digs up rotting corpses for fun – what the fuck’s going to faze him?”
“What about if he believed he’d created a zombie?” I asked, slowly forming the idea in my mind and I spoke.
His brow furrowed, “Believed?”
“Yeah!  So we break in and attach a new set of electrodes, just like he did!  Then, when he’s done the next rehearsal or whatever, we just keep them going for a bit!  He’ll shit himself!”
	“You’re right there,” he laughed, “But how do we do that?”
	“That’s the part I haven’t quite worked out yet.  I’m guessing that you’d need to know a bit about electronics and anatomy to be able to work out where the electricity needs to go,”
	“Wow!  Why didn’t I think of that?” he scoffed.
	“Look, it can’t be too hard, can it?  Let’s just wait until after the next rehearsal and we’ll have a look at what he does,”


	It was another week until we managed to find a way to get in without being seen.  The problem was that I got stopped on the way in.  One of the new staff knew my Dad and recognised me.  He sent me home, and so Ste was in on his own.
I got a text from Ste the next day, it said: “IN THE CELLAR.  MEET AT 01:00”.
	I arrived late the next night, and when I got there he wasn’t there.  I assumed that he’d given up waiting and gone home, so I headed back.  As I walked back through the gardens, I sent him a message, apologising for being late.  I wasn’t really looking where I was going and suddenly, I tripped over something lying on the ground.
Turning round to see what it was that I’d just tripped over, I went cold.  It was a dead body, but not just any dead body – it was one of the ones that Bert had been using as actors - well, it was either that, or no one had spotted a rotting corpse in the middle of Buxton for the last two years!  When I looked closer, I realised that it was moving.  Very slightly, but it was twitching and jerking very slightly.
	I phoned Ste again, but couldn’t get an answer from his phone.  I was just about to hang up when I heard something.  It wasn’t until I hung up that I finally realised what I could hear.  The noise stopped as I hung up, so I dialled again and it started again.  It was very faint, but it was Ste’s phone.  I headed towards the sound – it was leading me back into the gardens.
	As I stepped through the gate to enter, I saw a crowd of, what looked like people.  They were sat of the grass like they were having a picnic.  
It was nearly 2am.
One of them had Ste’s phone.
Suddenly, the closest one to me jerked up violently, like an invisible noose had pulled him neck.  His head lolled, rolling back and forth.
“Daniel!  Dear!”
I looked around and saw Bert.  He had a something in his hand that looked like a control for a remote control car; clearly he was operating the body before me.
“I’ve seen your friend Steve tonight!” he said.
His voice was still shrill, but it seemed to have adopted something of a sinister tone to it.
It was then that I saw Ste, behind Bert.  He was moving in the same manner as all the others.
“You killed him,” I managed to squeak, backing away.
“No, Dear!” replied Bert with indignation.
“He’s one of them,” I said.  
I took another step back and lost my footing.  Scrambling back on the floor, I realised that I’d lost my footing because one of my feet had become stuck inside a body.  I started to retch.
“You misunderstand,” replied Bert.
Finally, amongst my wheezing and retching,  I got to my feet.  Then I ran at Bert.  I screamed and pushed him to the ground.  I took the controls from him and stamped them into the ground.
As I did so, all the bodies collapsed, except Ste’s.  He started to spasm, jerking violently where he stood.
“You bloody idiot!  You’ve killed him!” shouted Bert.
So I ran.

And now I’m here at his funeral.  I haven’t seen Bert since, and I haven’t told anyone.
In my head, I can hear Ste banging from the inside of the coffin.  Suddenly, I realise that the sermon has stopped, and everyone is looking at the coffin.  I leave the graveyard.  I have to find Bert.
