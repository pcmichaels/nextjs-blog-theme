The bell rang, followed by a thick gurgling sound.  A thick porridge like substance bubbled into a long, wide trough that ran along one side of the cave.

Tendrils of smoke slowly climbed the walls of the cave, pulling gently at the moss and slime that covered most of that section.  The lights near the food flicked on, casting harsh shadows of the approaching figures against the opposite walls.

Duncan watched the shadows as they grew bigger and less defined on the wall in front of him; vaguely wondering what he might make of the shadows, had he never seen the people that cast them.

He crept over to the food trough, his eyes furtively casting about.  He stood around five feet tall.  Long clumps of brown hair hung down to his shoulders, covering his misshapen ears.

“Oi!  Move you little toad!” 

The giant looked down at Duncan and growled, then violently slapped his huge hands together just inches from Duncan’s nose.  Duncan jumped violently in shock, tripping backwards.

The giant roared with laughter, and then returned to the trough and filled his bowl.  He was a Rock Carrier.

Duncan backed away to the edge of the trough and quickly filled his bowl, never taking his eyes of the Rock Carrier.  Once he’d filled his bowl, he slunk back into the shadows.  He navigated his way back to his seat, avoiding various groups of Rock Carriers and Pickers. 

Before returning to his seat, Duncan diverted and silently moved over to one of the Pickers.

“You’re Karl, aren’t you?” he mumbled, staring into his bowl.

The Picker grunted and turned to Duncan, “Go away!” 

The tone was harsh, but he spoke very quietly.  Karl, like most Pickers was very broad, but no taller than Duncan.

“I can get us out,” said Duncan.

The Picker laughed, “Out of what?”

Duncan gestured around him, “Out of the cave!” 

Karl laughed again, “You talk like a Burner,” he eyed Duncan intensely, “Maybe the rumours are true?” 

Duncan’s eyes raged at this, “You’re very brave for a Picker!” he snarled, leaning close to Karl and grabbing his shirt, his fist clenched until his bony knuckled shone through white.

Karl squealed and one of the larger Rock Carriers turned.  Duncan watched as twenty-five stone of muscle and sinew stomped towards them.

“Who’s the Rock Carrier then?”

“A friend,” Karl smiled, “Now go away!”

Duncan looked at the Rock Carrier, he was massive.  His hair was tied at the back, like all Rock Carriers and his face was flat and expressionless.

The Rock Carrier looked in disgust at Duncan, “Move away, Runner.  If that is what you are!” 

Karl risked quiet laugh at this jibe.

Duncan smiled, too, looking at the Rock Carrier and shaking his head, “You plod about breaking your back every day.  You never question why - you just look to everyone else to blame!  If it wasn’t for the runners, you’d have a lifespan of less that a single cycle!” he looked at Karl, “Both of you depend on the runners, but you treat us like scum!”

The Rock Carrier reached out to grab Duncan by the hair.  Suddenly Duncan regretted his outburst.

“I can get you out.”  He said quickly, turning back to Karl, “Both of you,”

Karl shook his head and looked at the Rock Carrier, “He’s mad, Arnold!” 

“What do you mean, ‘out’?” the Rock Carrier asked Duncan.

“Out of this cave,”

Karl laughed again, “Outside the cave?”

Arnold’s brow furrowed; he held a hand up to silence Karl.  He looked again at Duncan, “Go on,”

Duncan let go of Karl's shirt, and Karl scurried over to hide behind Arnold, his short legs and squat form hampering his progress.

“Arnold,” he said when he'd reached safety, “Remember our deal – make him leave me alone!”

“I remember,” replied Arnold, reaching towards Duncan.

“If we find The Control then we will find a way out,” blurted Duncan, before the outstretched arm reached him.

Arnold laughed, “Is that the best you can do?  We must find the fabled Control!”

“Leave him alone,” said Arnold, gesturing to Karl, “He's protected.”

Arnold began to move away.

“Have anyone ever looked outside the cave?” asked Duncan.

“That’s because we're inside the cave and that’s all there is!”  Karl answered, looking irritated.

“There’s a way in to the cave!”  Duncan said.  Arnold stopped and turned to face them; renewed interest on his face.

“There’s no way in and there’s no way out – there is nowhere else!”  Karl replied, pulling at Arnold's arm to move away.

“Where did this come from then?”  Duncan spun Karl’s bowl towards him.

“My bowl?” asked Karl.

“Yes, your bowl, the food - there are other things here that did not come from inside the cave, which means there must be another place,”

“The trough is filled from underneath!” said the Rock Carrier, his tone scathing.

“That’s right – from beneath, but not from inside the cave.  I’ve felt the pipe and it is big enough to crawl through.”

He took something out of his pocket and handed it to Arnold.  It was a strip of blue, soft material about two inches across and half an inch wide; on the underside of it was a white strip with a single faded red dot.

“What’s this?” asked Arnold.

“I don’t know,” replied Duncan, “But I know it didn’t come from inside the cave – those materials don’t exist inside the cave!”

“Okay, say you’re right.  A little Runner like you might fit through, but I doubt even Karl would fit through!” said Arnold.

“After I’ve found a way out, I’ll come back for you, but I need your help - ”

The bell rang.

Everyone in the cave began filing back to their respective tasks. 

Duncan stayed where he was, waiting for a call.  

The first warning came through moments later.  Three beeps.  He listened for the bell, indicating which tunnel.  When it sounded, he sprinted towards the fourth tunnel, shouting, “Fourth!  Weak at two-thirds!” 

Even as he approached the tunnel, the Pickers from the final third of the tunnel were filing out.  He sprinted into the tunnel, no longer shouting, but looking for any stray Pickers.  He found none and turned to retreat.  The lattes holding the earth up gave way and the tunnel collapsed, killing him instantly.

***

Duncan sat in the corner of the main cave and watched as his bowl fell from his hands and bounced a few feet away.  He stared at the spilled contents of his bowl.  His hands were shaking.  
Karl, startled by the sound, moved over to where he was sat and picked up the bowl.
“Something’s wrong,” Duncan commented as Karl offered the bowl to him.
“Wrong?”
“I haven’t been properly re-generated,” replied Duncan, “My hands shake all the time and I’m slower!”
“That’s ridiculous!”  Replied Karl, shaking his head.
“It’s true, look at me.  I can’t even run properly any more.  I don’t understand, but I can remember!”
Karl's eyes widened and he turned slightly pale.    He lowered his voice to an anxious whisper, “You remember!”
“Yes, I can remember everything up until the cave in.” he looked at Karl, “I remember you!”
Karl backed away, “Maybe it’s a punishment for talking about The Control!”
Duncan just sat there, his hands still shaking and allowed his bowl to fall again, watching Karl scuttle away and listening absently to the sound of the bowl as it bounced and rolled around the floor.  The work bell rang and he watched as everyone, except the Runners filed back to their tasks.  The warnings came through, but he didn’t move.  He could think of nothing else to do; he couldn’t run any more, so he simply sat there, waiting and thinking.  
He watched as the food trough emptied, as it always did during working hours.  He looked into the tunnel that piped the food into the trough.  
He did nothing.
He had lost something in the last regeneration, but he had also gained something: his memory.  He began to remember further back.  He remembered previous regenerations.
Warnings rang for weakening tunnels, but he didn’t move.  The bell rang for meal after meal.  He just sat and stared at the food trough.
He remembered his first regeneration as a Runner, and before that, he remembered himself as a Burner.
Duncan remembered.


He’d now been watching the cycle for two days; the food was pumped in a short time before the break bell rang, and the remaining food was sucked out a short time after the following bell.  The troughs then stayed empty until the next break.
He listened to the bells ring as he waited.  He listened to the screams of the trapped workers as caves collapsed.  He watched as they re-appeared later, emerging seamlessly from the shadows of the cave.  
He counted in his head between them emptying and re-filling.
The bell rang.
Gradually each worker filled their bowl and found a place on the cave floor to sit.
The bell rang again.
The food troughs began to empty.
Duncan edged over to the troughs to see the last drops of food being sucked from the troughs.  As the echo of the last slurp dissipated, Duncan peered into the tunnel.  It was dark, but definitely wide enough for him to crawl through.  
He climbed into the tunnel, head first.  A small sliver of light from the room behind him allowed him to see his own arms for a short time, but as he progressed, the light dimmed.  For the first few feet, he used his feet to stop himself falling, as the tunnel ran sharply downwards.
Behind him, he could hear the chattering of the remaining runners – some had seen him enter the tunnel.
The tunnel began to level out and then it descended again.  At first, the decent was gradual, but it became steeper, until Duncan was grappling at the sides to avoid slipping.  It was no use, the slimy walls gave him nothing to hold and he slid.  The tunnel curved downwards in an arc, for an instant Duncan was free-falling, and then it curved back on itself, and finally levelled out.
He began to panic.  The sides of the tunnel clawed at him with the dank, musty stench of rotting food.  He crawled faster – the thought of drowning in boiling gruel spurring him on.  The tunnel sloped upwards and he slowed as he shuffled upwards, using his feet to stop him falling backwards.
After what seemed like an eternity of edging upwards the tunnel levelled out.  
Crawling faster now, he started to hear a buzzing sound.  A sliver of light was becoming more defined as he scrambled along the tunnel, ever second expecting a torrent of boiling, liquid food to drown him.
As he crawled forward the light grew brighter.  It was a strange light – like nothing he’d ever seen inside the cave – it was brighter and more intense.
In a terrified panic he headed for the light.  As he reached it, he saw there was a hole in the side of the tunnel, but as he tried to push through it, he found that some invisible force prevented him from exiting the tunnel.  He looked around the edge of the hole, and realised that the invisible force was actually a transparent material.  Through it, he could see a room.
The room was completely different from anything he’d ever seen.  The walls were made from something smooth – not rock.  The room was mainly grey.  It was lit by panels on the walls and ceiling.  Other lights flashed at various places along the walls.
A man, wearing a white coat stood at the lights, he turned and looked at Duncan.  
The white-coated man smiled and, approaching the transparent screen, he pressed a button next to it.  The screen slid away, and he helped Duncan to climb out.  The man then pressed another button and the screen slid shut again.
The man pressed one of the lights and the tunnel that Duncan had just left was flooded with liquid food.
“Hello, Duncan,” said the man.
Duncan looked at the man for a long time.  He had done it – he had found The Control!  Terror, excitement and anticipation vied to be credited with the tears that now streamed down his face.
“Control?”
“I am a controller, yes,” said the man, still smiling, “My name is David.”
Duncan's head swam with a thousand questions.
“I want to leave The Cave,” he said, remembering why he started out.
“Why?  Where would you go?” replied David, “You were built for The Cave.”
“Is there anything outside The Cave?”
David began circling Duncan, frequently stopping and tapping his chin with his finger, “Err… Yes – yes, there is,” he replied, absently.
“What?”
“Oh, other things – countries, cities, green fields…” he mumbled absently, occasionally poking Duncan.  Suddenly he returned his attention to the subject, “And there is war, famine and violence!” he paused again and then added, “You should stay in the cave.”
“But I want to leave,” challenged Duncan, weakly.
David laughed, “You were built to save on labour costs.”
“Why were you built?” asked Duncan.
“Only God knows that.”
“God is another Control?” asked Duncan.
“Yes, in a way,” said David, “I can’t believe that your cognitive development has come so far as to want independence!”
“What are ‘labour costs’?” asked Duncan.
“It’s complicated.  It also saves lives having you in the cave,” answered David.
“What will happen when I die?” asked Duncan.
Again, David laughed at this question, “You’re not alive.  When you die we simply transfer your memory chip to a new body.
“I’ve slowed down a lot!  I can remember things,” he looked at David pleadingly, “What does that mean?”
“There’s a virus in the system,” replied David, “We have it under control.  We can restore your working skills with the next re-gen, but we won’t be able to erase the memories that you’ve acquired.”
Duncan looked confused.  He thought hard to recall some of the questions he had for The Control.
“Why is there evil in the cave?”
David looked confused, “There is no ‘evil’ in the cave.”
“Yes, sorry – no, there is no evil.  Your creation is perfect!” stammered Duncan, suddenly mortally afraid that he’d offended The Control.
“What do you mean by evil?” asked David.
“Nothing, Control!”
“Go on,” prompted David.
“Well, the Rock Carriers are the strongest race, and so they take the food first.  Anyone that challenges them is hurt or killed!  The tunnels cave in, sometimes.  Even if we do everything right, the tunnels still cave in, and sometimes many are crushed!”
A look of realisation crossed David’s face; his brow furrowed deeply.
“Duncan, those things are not evil, they are just physics and life.  The strong and powerful always take advantage over the weak - that is the way all societies work.  The tunnels collapse if you mine them too deep, or there is a tremor in the earth – it’s just the way of things,”
“Why am I a runner?  Why do the ‘tremors’ come?”
“You are who you are,” David shrugged, “The tremors, well – we can’t predict them yet – but maybe we will one day,”
Suddenly, a bell rang.  It was a sound like nothing Duncan had ever heard – he covered his ears.  The ear-splitting sound reverberated around the room in short bursts.
“The phone,” David looked confused, “Err…” 
He reached for Duncan’s head and put his hand to the back of his neck.


Duncan was sat in the corner of the cave when Arnold approached him.
“What happened to you?  You weren’t working, and then you disappeared – some of the runners said they saw you go into the tunnel?”
Karl, noticing the two, made his way over to where they were sat.
“Yes - I’ve seen The Control” Duncan’s eyes burned with passion, “I went through the food tunnel!”
The other two looked shocked.
“What did you see?” asked Arnold.
“The Control is named ‘David’.  He is truly great!  He told what our purpose is!”
“What is it?” asked Arnold.
“It is to save ‘Labour Costs’!”
“What is ‘Labour Costs’?”  Karl asked.
“They are so great and powerful a thing, that he couldn’t tell me.  Our purpose is to save them.”
“They are in danger?” asked Karl.
“Yes.”
As they spoke, more and more workers gathered round to listen to the sermon delivered by Duncan.  
“What else did you learn?” asked Karl, eagerly.
“There is more than one ‘Control’ – there are two!  The second is named ‘God’”
“Two?” Arnold asked, incredulously, “That’s absurd!  How can there be two – it makes no sense!  Did you see this second Control, God?”
Duncan shrugged, “No, God is a subordinate Control to David – he knows nothing of ‘Labour Costs’, or ‘tremors’ – only David knows of those!”
“Are ‘tremors’ another Control?” asked Arnold.
“They are a kind of Control, but they are evil – they cause the cave-ins.  I think that it is these that threaten the ‘Labour Costs’.  While the ‘tremors’ are persecuting us, the ‘Labour Costs’ are safe!”
“Why do the ‘tremors’ not show themselves?” asked Karl.
“I don’t know – but you must not fear them!  The Control has decreed that we can never die!”
Arnold shook his head, “But sometimes we don’t get regenerated!”
Duncan’s brow furrowed and he paused a second, then he replied, “They have gone to be with The Control!  This must be the reward for living a good life – freedom from these endless regenerations and living in paradise with The Control!”
“While I was there, a work bell rang – it was a different tone to anything that I’ve ever heard - it rang in bursts.  When it rang, The Control touched my head, and I was regenerated instantly!”
A hushed gasp rose from the gathered crowd.

 
The bell rang for the return to work.  The workers filed enthusiastically to their jobs, while Duncan and the other runners waited for the calls.
