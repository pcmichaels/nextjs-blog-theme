Death Row



	Awful lonely place, prison. Awful lonely. Believe me, I know. Been’n this cell for two days, two days! ‘n it gets awful lonely. ‘Sheriff comes around now ‘n ‘gen to gimme some food ‘n the like, but on the whole it’s just me. They’re s’posed to be hangin’ me ‘n the mornin’. Y’see I killed a man three days ago, shot ‘im in the back! ‘n fact, I emptied a six shooter into that dood’s back! Now where I come from, no one should get up from that! No one who wasn’t already dead any ways!
	I can see ‘em buildin’ the gallows from ma’ cell, an’ when I can’t see ‘em I can hear ‘em! Bangin’ away, at ‘em for most o’ the day. Well, I don’t s’pose I’m the first man to hang for killin’ someone who was still alive, nope, I don’t s’pose I’ll be the first and I don’t s’pose I’ll be the last. I’ll tell ya somethin’ though, I reckon I’ll be the first man to hang for killin’ a man that’s already dead. Yep, I reckon I must be the first all right and god willin’ I’ll be the last, too!
	Damn Cold in here! Damn cold! Y’feel the cold more when you’re ‘bout to die I s’pose. Y’think ‘bout strange things too. Heaven n’ Hell, y’think ‘bout them a lot. Makes sense really I s’pose. I wonder if God’ll hold this killin’ against me? I’ve led a descent life on the whole, I’ve always been an honest man. I wouldn’t say God-fearin’ but in my line o’ work it’s kinda hard to do that.
	Strange really that I’m feelin’ so scared. I’ve looked down the barrel of a gun more times’n I can remember and I’ve never feared death. But I’m frightened now I don’t mind tellin’ ya that, mighty frightened! 
The dood I shot, I’ve seen him round. He stands outside ma cell now n’gen. I told the sheriff when he first put me in here, I told him I’d seen this dood get up, looked me straight in the eyes he did. That sent a chill straight down my spine, there was nothin’ behind those cold eyes of his, it was like lookin’ at a corpse! An’ I reckon’ that’s just what I was doin’, lookin’ at a corspe. Musta been a corpse or a ghost, like I said, six shots went into him, put him down good n’ proper. At first I thought I’d missed, I was sure of it, although I’ve never missed before and I wasn’t shootin’ from the hip. Like I said, he took it in the back, gave me plenty of time to aim n’ fire! An’ after the first shot he dropped with a thud, the other five went in just as smoothly, bouncin’ him around in the dirt.
Damn! It’s past nine already, it went dark only a few hours ago, an’ they’d just finished with the gallows in time. It’s pitch dark outside, but I can still see that dood, the dood I shot. I can see him through the bars, just lookin’ at me with those empty eyes. He’s lookin’ exactly the same’s he did three days ago, when I shot him down. His long coat, draped down to just below his knees; his face, mostly shaded by his hat but ya can still see him squintin’, like he’d been cut there or somethin’; He aint totin’ any guns, never did, never needed ‘em.
Thinkin’ ‘bout that day it seems like it was an awful long time ago. The memory’s real blurred. I remember when he arrived in town. He rode in on a black horse, I remember that well, jet black, like the night it was. I was sat at the bar when he walked into the saloon n’ sat just next to me. He never spoke to anyone, ‘cept me. He just ignored everyone else, like they wasn’t even there. They ignored him just the same. They don’t like strangers round here. He spoke to me though. He asked me if there was any place to stay in town, anywhere that might have a room spare. Told ‘im to try ol’ Milly’s boardin’ house, her place is mostly where strangers end up, those passin’ through anyways. But he wasn’t, he wasn’t passin’ through, he was here to stay and he told me as much. Said he’d some folks over this way, said he’d be stayin’ with them soon’s he’d located ‘em. Didn’t know who his folks were at the time, never asked an’ he never told. O’ Course, if he had I might of shot him down there ‘n then, right at the bar – If I’d have known then that is.
I never gave him course to speak with me, I’ve never been a particularly friendly kinda guy, I never really wanted any company there at the bar. He was askin’ me about the town, said he’d grown up here, said he moved away when he was only a child, but that he’d always wanted to come back, come back ‘n see his folks. We musta sat there, me and this dood for well over an hour, talkin’ ‘bout the town. Talkin’ bout it’s past, the things that’ve happened ‘round here over the last few years. I grew up here myself, so I know a little about the town and I’m quite proud of it. My daddy was the sheriff ‘round here for seven years, he was a proud man and he was proud of the town, just like me.
It wasn’t until much later on that I realised. It was somethin’ he said, I remember he said ‘bout the time him an’ his folks left town. It musta been that that made me realise who he was. The stranger was the son of Martha Wilks. The same Martha Wilks that killed my daddy and my brother just over five years ago. I remember the day they left town, him and his ma n’ pa! I remember how they’d left in fear of their lives after the children began disappearin’. I was too young at the time to remember the facts, I was only six when they left, but I remember the legend of Martha Wilks, I remember that like it was printed on the back of my brain. Martha was a local girl, well liked by all accounts, plenty o’ friends, very popular and mighty good lookin’. People are mighty superstitious round here. It’s mainly fear if you’re askin’ my opinion. People are always frightened. Mostly they’re frightened of shadows, fairy tales ‘n such like. They had good course to be frightened of Martha though, she was evil, pure evil! Not from the start you understand, it was the stranger who came into town.
Rumour has it that he was a demon of some kind but I never believed that, I never liked the dood though, not one bit. He was an odd sort of fella, he just strolled on into town one day. He wasn’t even on a horse, which is mighty strange as the next town’s well over thirty mile north of here. He was dressed in black, wore a long black coat, just like his son. He wore a sheriff’s badge too, nobody asked much about that though. Nobody asked much of him at all. He had a kinda shifty look about him. He was the kinda dood you’d rather stay clear of and most of the town did just that. Not Martha though. No, Sir! She was in love from the first time she saw him, buzzin’ around him like an insect. He didn’t seem interested at first, politely refusin’ her advances (which were a little too blatant for the rest of the town).
I dunno why, but eventually he seemed to fall for her as well. After that they were never seen apart. The other strange thing about that dood was he never seemed to do anything, he didn’t look like he had a dollar to his name but he didn’t seem to work at anything either. He kept Martha in the style of a queen, always buyin’ her this n’ fetchin’ her that. Some o’ the town reckoned he might be a sheriff run out of another town or the son of a millionaire. I don’t think he was either, I don’t think he’d ever done anything before he came here. I don’t think he needed to.
He’s still there y’know. Stood outside my cell. It’s pitch black now, but I can still see him, almost like he's glowin or somethin’. Even when I don’t look, I can see he’s there. He always there, watchin’ me.
Martha kinda reminded my of my own ma. She’s ‘bout the same age and looks. She always seemed to have a soft spot for me too. I ain’t sure why she eventually turned on me, killin’ my pa and my brother like that. I ain’t sure why she went for me with a butchers knife, carvin’ a thick line in my face like that. I ain’t even sure why she never killed me, she had the chance alright. I aint sure, but I’m sure glad she’s dead! Yes, Sir! I’m sure glad she’d dead an’ burnin’ in hell! I’m sure glad I was there to watch her swing for what she did. I’ll probably be joinin’ her soon, maybe I’ll ask her then why she killed my pa. She loved him once – I remember that, but that’s the past.
Like I said, I ain’t afraid of dyin’ but I am scared. Maybe I’m scared to see the look on the face of the dood I shot when he watches me hang. And he will, I know that, he’ll watch me swing and he’ll laugh. I can see his face now, smikin’ at me. He’s mockin’ me.
It was only a few months after they met that Martha was wed. Almost the whole town packed the church I believe. They wished them well and although they hated the stranger with a loathin’ born entirely from fear, they loved Martha just as much. They loved her because they knew her, they all knew her. They knew her ma and pa before her. The family was a god-fearin’ family, her pa was preacher in the chapel for a spell. He died long before I was born though.
Only a few months after they were wed and Martha announced she was with child. There were a few raised brows in the town, but no one said anythin’. It was fine by them s’long as it was christened and Martha attended church every Sunday. Of course, Martha always attended church, Sunday and most other days too. No one ever saw the stranger there though. Martha always sat in the same spot and no one ever spotted her husband by her side or anyplace else in the chapel. N‘fact, no one saw very much of him at all.
It must be gone midnight now. I can feel the time slippin’ away. I can sense the night creeping forward into day. I start to scream, for the jailer, for the judge, or for God! I dunno which and I dunno why. Like I say, I was never afraid of death. I’m cryin’, tears fallin’ to the ground, splashin’ in the dust on the cell floor. I pull the bars, tryin’ to prise them apart, screamin’ for the jailer! Then I turn to him, the guy I shot, the dead guy! I shout at him, Shout at him pleadin’ with him to tell them, to let them know he’s still alive. To tell them that he isn’t dead but still alive and stood right outside my damn cell.
He won’t though, he just stands there, looking blankly at me. Remindin’ me that he’s gonna finish the job his ma started n’ see me swingin’. I can see his smirk turn to a smile and then a laugh! He’s laughin’ at me, just like he’ll be laughin in the mornin’. When they string me up, he’ll be watchin’ an’ laughin!
It wasn’t long after Martha gave birth that she announced she was pregnant again. The second child was born in the followin’ summer. That’s the dood that’s stood outside my cell. He was the youngest, but he wasn’t the last. Martha gave birth the another child after him, but he was stillborn. Some folks said that was what finally drove her over the edge. Some said it was her husband that poisoned her mind. They said that her husband was evil and made her do them things. She always said she was innocent and the judge wouldn’t hang her on the superstitions of a town. He just advised her to leave for her own safety and that of her two children.
Five children in all that went missin’ from the town. Such a thing had never happened before and the townspeople were so shocked they needed someone to blame. Most picked on Martha and her husband because he was a stranger. Like I said, people don’t take kindly to strangers round here! When they left town they barely escaped with their lives. They fled from the town with just what they had on their backs, cursing the town and it’s people.
It was later that they came back. The feelin’ had died down by then, n’ they’d found someone else to hang for the disappearances of those five children. They seemed to fit straight back into their old lives. No one mentioned what’d happened. There’s always the whispers, the comments behind closed doors. There were always the suspicions. Martha never went to church much after she came back to town. Some folks reckoned they heard her arguin’ with her husband but no one said much ‘bout it. Folks round here seemed happy to leave them alone s’long ‘s they stayed to themselves.
And they did pretty much. Stayed to themselves, right up until the night o’ the killin’. That’s a night I remember very well and one I’ll remember right up until they see me danglin’!
I remember how she burst through the door, hair all messed up like she’d been in a fight. How she picked up the kitchen knife almost without thinkin’. I remember how she went straight to my daddy and jammed it straight in his guts. I remember the look on his face, it wasn’t as much surprise as of shock. How his face took on that macabre grin and hers the look of satisfaction n’ pleasure ‘s she twisted it and then allowed him to slide to the floor. I remember how she grabbed my brother by the hair, pullin’ his head back n’ slittin’ neatly across his throat with the bloodstained knife. How he just looked at her helplessly as he fell to the floor, clutching the gash in his neck. It was after that she turned to me. 
She turned to me and looked me straight in the eyes. As I looked in those eyes I knew I was starin’ into the soul of a demon. A demon with a thirst for blood. My blood.
I remember how she grabbed me that night. The same way she’d grabbed my brother just before she cut neat red line, straight through his neck. I could see him on the floor, blood pumpin’ from the slit she’d carved into his neck. He was still tryin’ to gasp for breath, ya’ could tell, his chest heavin’ for air that wouldn’t come, trapped by the blood cloggin’ his windpipe. She slowly raised the knife to my face, just a half an inch from my eye. She started there and began carefully carvin’ a groove in my face, straight from my eye, back to my ear. I still can feel the scar today. 
She said something to me as well that night. She told me to remember, to always remember. I was never entirely sure exactly what she meant by that, maybe it was the rantings of a madwoman, maybe it was a warnin'. She let me loose then.

It’s light outside. Time is short. I can still see him, stood outside the cell. I shout to them that he’s there, that you can’t hang me for killin’ someone who ain’t dead. They will though, I know they will and suddenly I feel calm. When they come for me I don’t put up a struggle. I walk the steps to the gallows and stand above the trapdoor. It’s so peaceful when you know your fate, when you know exactly what will happen. The hangman hooks the rope around my neck. The preacher’s there, he says some prayers over me, asks if I repent. I just shake my head. I can’t repent for killin’ anyone who’s still alive. I look round, he’s stood there, right in front of the gallows, laughin’ openly now. Laughin’ at me. Then I see the lever being pulled and feel the ground from beneath me give way. I feel grateful.

	It’s a dry, bright summer’s day. The wind, just enough cause a calm wind through the town. An old man stood by a makeshift gallows turns to his companion.
	“Shame,” an old man mutters. He nods his head, obviously referring to the corpse swinging slowly back and forth, causing a slight creak in the gallows. It’s not regret on the old mans face, only pity.
	“What’s his story anyway?”
	“Funny thing it was. He was only six when they hanged his mother here. She just went mad one day. Killed her husband, who was the sheriff at the time and his elder brother.”
	“That so?”
“There was a spate of child disappearances earlier that year that they blamed her for too. No one ever knew whether it was her or not though.”
